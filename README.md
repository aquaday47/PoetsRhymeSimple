Got on a roll creating this app, used a few horizontally oriented LinearLayouts within two separate vertically oriented LinearLayouts nested within a RelativeLayout.
Pretty cool

Initial problems with the gradle build surrounded the lack of self-closing tags for my TextViews.  I noticed that, added '/>' and was on my way to viewing this on my phone.
